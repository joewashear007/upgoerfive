# upgoerfive
Node.js version of XKCD's [Up Goer Five Text Editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/)

`npm install upgoerfive`

##Features
**This is still being devleoped**

This script has a couple different features

* Checker - This is what the original "Up Goer Five Text Editor" had. Simple checks for words that are not in the list. 
* Replacer - Tries to auto replace words in your text with that are not in the 1000 word dictionary. Not 100% accurate.
